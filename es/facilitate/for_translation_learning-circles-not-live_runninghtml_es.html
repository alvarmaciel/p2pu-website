    <p data-tx-text="b2d7947af4e78a8493f035c46519642e_se">Everyone attends Learning Circles for different reasons. Some people 
    want to build social relationships in a quasi-academic setting, others 
    are there because they want to learn the skills they need to get a new 
    job, and others attend purely for the sake of learning something new. As
     a facilitator, it is your job to understand each individual’s motivation for
     joining and cultivate an environment in which learners can clearly see
     how the Learning Circle will help them achieve their desired goals.</p> 
    <p data-tx-text="9485bd5f38e99b8e69e6cf28a9e0138c_se">To help you accomplish this, we’ve included some handy tips from past 
    facilitators, followed by an outline of the general flow that your 
    Learning Circle will follow.</p>


    <h2 data-tx-text="4279839a817764da99619cb06f29428b_se">Facilitation tips</h2>
    <p class="list-below" data-tx-text="ce751ea4d2bc7887c2a0c46929d95c0d_se">Good facilitation includes a number of different tasks:</p>
    <ul>
<li data-tx-text="70f3a7e6bb1fcab9bdebaed8ce5a9d23_se">Listen to learners</li>
    <li data-tx-text="8514648827d5c1a967ba6aa215f4bc29_se">Ask clarifying statements</li>
    <li data-tx-text="2cf1b652d703645ddeab1ea42d5d2c05_se">Provide good feedback</li>
    <li data-tx-text="33511d1e154339d12130a08f5e9bb65f_se">Keep discussions on task</li>
    <li data-tx-text="42b48f9acc199ee6759a5e4af281a3c5_se">Probe assumptions and evidence</li>
    <li data-tx-text="31ecee9cca87389b3146eb01e34a1d8e_se">Elicit viewpoints and perspectives</li>
    <li data-tx-text="dd856259a9d6cc296a1e3112c596329a_se">Mediate conflicts</li>
    <li data-tx-text="6fb2586c0cf549c4d7013dc572a440cd_se">Summarize and present findings</li>
    </ul>
<p data-tx-text="0097408425fcdf4aae7f4b7880b415ac_se">That’s a lot, but don’t worry, nobody is expecting you to be perfect from day one, and it will become much easier with practice. Below you'll find a number of tips (and a few video links) on how to become a star facilitator.</p>

    <h4 data-tx-text="48988cae251613545a39d3095b939f0a_se"><a href="https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/peer-learning-between-students">Model peer learning</a></h4>
    <p data-tx-text="fc0f957f1a93e20e3bf3dd9cad2f8b15_se">For most people, learning has been a passive experience of 
    “receiving” instruction. They may be unaccustomed to taking 
    responsibility for their own and the group’s learning. This is not what 
    Learning Circles are about, and it is important to be clear about this, 
    especially in the first few weeks. As a facilitator, you can be a role 
    model for the group by engaging learners in problem-solving and actively
     reaching out to help when possible.</p>

    <h4 data-tx-text="57754cdfce923c808e9118eb51b1b262_se">Maintain awareness</h4>
    <p data-tx-text="ec158d58819cd4f125038d89ef5b384e_se">Be observant, and learn to read the energy of the room. Who seems 
    really motivated today? Who is particularly quiet? Once you have an 
    understanding of each learner’s goals, you’ll be able to respond to this 
    energy productively. Is one learner quiet because they are struggling 
    with a basic concept? Ask somebody who is a few steps ahead if they 
    don’t mind helping out.</p>

    <h4 data-tx-text="ce05c26e7c7c13a141f8d3bbc81afd56_se">Strive to help learners self-identify as members of the group</h4>
    <p class="list-below" data-tx-text="edcea008dfe38ea39c9974927ed32199_se">This is called social cohesion. Social cohesion 
    begins to develop within an hour of people being together. Some examples
     for encouraging social cohesion include:</p>
    <ul>
<li data-tx-text="d3178bb63987b7c7c50afe9a105b2ecb_se">Agreeing on a group name</li>
    <li data-tx-text="9e6804311410cf72e83d6691576f0a93_se">Using non-verbal symbols (mascot, logo, colors)</li>
    <li data-tx-text="c23402ac035b65d60ee7a3078b1c7a4c_se">Establishing rituals (traditions, habits, weekly activities)</li>
    <li data-tx-text="37715f8af634a37912e93298ce0264fb_se">Using plural pronouns (“we” instead of “I”)</li>
    <li data-tx-text="fab6642fa306ef37b61fdbf570331349_se">Invoking group metaphors (referring to group as family, team, etc.)</li>
    <li data-tx-text="b55e1eab4b426749a5fbee26b7ee2e42_se">Making verbal pledges (commitments to future action)</li>
    <li data-tx-text="a6e48b3ef1f435316e55956926e36587_se">Establishing group narrative (saying things like “Remember when we…”)</li>
    <li data-tx-text="d58f61fc8a6a57c4f7734ee5daa911e7_se">Developing groupspeak (inside jokes, jargon)</li>
    </ul>
<h4 data-tx-text="d18fba16215f7170e74e9f7cba7e547f_se"><a href="https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/questions-for-inquiry-based-teaching">Ask probing questions</a></h4>
    <p data-tx-text="a7c9499c0819f913f83df0b290e7cbfb_se">Learners will ask you many content related questions, since you are 
    the closest thing to the traditional teacher in the room. When a learner
     asks, your response should demonstrate that their peers are a valuable 
    resource, and that most questions are answerable if you know where to 
    look. Examples of responses you might give are:
    I’m not sure, did you ask anyone else if they ran up against the same 
    problem?
    Hmmm, where would you start looking to figure that out?</p> 

    <h4 data-tx-text="1fb8db983778781ef38985932a640557_se">Encourage meaningful, frequent interactions between learners.</h4> 
    <p data-tx-text="be746dff8cac81bf7c4034a980a2bc71_se">Shared emotional connections serve the dual purpose of helping 
    individuals learn and reinforcing community. Watch out for questions or 
    conversations that de-focus the group, and get comfortable steering 
    conversations back on track. Other participants will greatly appreciate 
    this.</p>


    <h4 data-tx-text="0db3310965263c5708e5b2c7512edc7f_se">Manage expectations</h4>
    <p data-tx-text="f047f2231b26924efe9a94cac8223fbc_se">When learning something new, there is a fine line between being 
    optimistic and discouraged. To navigate this, express confidence that 
    learners can achieve their goals, while also being realistic and aware 
    of what is possible in six weeks. For instance, it's unlikely that 
    somebody with no programming background will get a programming job after
     one HTML/CSS Learning Circle. However, they will gain a better 
    understanding of how to build a website, get a sense as to whether this 
    is a subject they’d like to continue in, and have a peer group of 
    like-minded individuals they’ve gotten to know.</p>  

    <h4 data-tx-text="3f626fde168a2e2086d071399f963e65_se"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0OS4MrN3E">Encourage growth mindsets</a></h4> 
    <p data-tx-text="c934c2023036cacdc0b0804ea23ae856_se">A growth mindset is the belief that one’s skills and abilities can be
     continually developed through hard work, rather than stay fixed at a 
    certain level. As a facilitator, try praising a learner’s processes 
    (effort, strategies, choices) rather than their innate intelligence 
    (e.g. saying "you’re so smart!").</p> 

    <h4 data-tx-text="73c03d517c2cafd153e0d2243f195a58_se">Turn frustrations around</h4> 
    <p data-tx-text="59286522428f83b78208786501e2c498_se">Try to flip frustrations into positive statements and involve the 
    group. For example, when one learner felt that the interview tips in a Job Training 
    course were too basic, the facilitator asked the group if they could 
    come up with better tips. This re-framed the frustration in a positive 
    way and served as an opportunity for learners to work together.</p> 

    <h4 data-tx-text="c312db389c0a40b3538d96c907054902_se">Delegate responsibilities</h4> 
    <p class="list-below" data-tx-text="34fd168e484163e08376d58eb2517285_se">A good facilitator empowers learners to take 
    charge of their own learning, making the role of the facilitator smaller
     and smaller over time. As the Learning Circle progresses, the facilitator can 
    start asking learners to take on some extra responsibility, such as:</p> 
    <ul>
<li data-tx-text="64474a2cfadc5210e94d7173de827780_se">Send a wrap-up email afterwards reflecting on the day’s class</li>
    <li data-tx-text="67e4aa8722f0fa976ea7693ca23cd197_se">Summarize the week’s material at the beginning of each class</li>
    <li data-tx-text="c8a28d1268149f82b20a4af03d7c2ef0_se">Set up/clean up the space</li>
    <li data-tx-text="fa2c69e4b0e556a139c1a3a9ba024084_se">Share a resource or article that relates to the course content</li>
    <li data-tx-text="e32a653e3b9e39c35c0d2094ffa37f26_se">Help a learner who is struggling</li>
    <li data-tx-text="38e5dff0e794dc2aa54c7a3946d12aed_se">Bring snacks</li>
    </ul>
<h4 data-tx-text="734bed8ebc93f37be174c05a2304fcf8_se">Be reflective</h4>
    <p class="list-below" data-tx-text="8156d0d4e741ddbe004973b0754712d1_se">As a facilitator, you have a great deal of 
    influence over the atmosphere in your Circle. Ask yourself the following
     questions as you work through the six weeks:</p>
    <ul>
<li data-tx-text="00c122f9b02572c1dd0eca3fce692ce6_se">How might my cultural assumptions influence my interactions with learners?</li> 
    <li data-tx-text="eaacf3721ac15f869316b4b9686597fb_se">How might the backgrounds and experiences of learners influence their motivation, engagement, and learning?</li>
    <li data-tx-text="d572dad8bbe713622a3c071846d62100_se">How can I modify course materials, activities, facilitation 
    techniques, and expectations to be more accessible to all the learners 
    in my Learning Circle?</li>
    </ul>
