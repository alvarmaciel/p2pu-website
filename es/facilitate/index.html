    <p>Los círculos de aprendizaje son grupos de estudio ligeramente guiados para estudiantes que quieran, juntos, hacer cursos online libremente y en persona. P2PU puede ayudarte a crear un círculo de aprendizaje, <a href="https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/courses/"> encontrar cursos para estudiar</a>, o <a href="https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/">unirte a un Círculo de Aprendizaje en marcha</a>. We believe that 
    anybody can become a facilitator, and whether you want to run a single Learning Circle in your home or organize dozens across an urban library system, 
    you've come to the right place. Below are the three steps we recommend you take to get going!</p> 
    
    <h4 class="green space-top" style="font-size:24px; padding-bottom:15px;">Step 1: Create an account</h4>
   
    <p>We highly recommend <a href="https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/facilitator/signup/" target="_blank">signing up</a> to run your Learning Circle with our free software tools.
    These tools (collectively, we call them the Facilitator Dashboard) will generate a webpage where people can sign up for your Learning Circle, gather applications,
    allow you to communicate with learners via email or SMS, send learners automatic reminders before each Learning Circle, and prompt you to share weekly feedback with 
    learners, P2PU, and other facilitators around the world.</p>
       
    <h4 class="green space-top" style="font-size:24px; padding-bottom:15px;">Step 2: Read this guide</h4>
    <p>You can <a href="https://www.p2pu.org/assets/uploads/learning_circle_downloads/facilitator_handbook.pdf" target="_blank">download it all</a> as a .pdf, or read it online by navigating through 
    the tabs on the left. The guide includes tips, tricks, checklists and templates to help you advertise, prepare for, and run your Learning Circle. <!--Throughout, you’ll see 
    <i class="fa fa-desktop teal hpicon"></i> <span class="teal-highlights">green highlights</span> throughout that indicate how  online tools can support your Learning Circle.--></p>
       
    <h4 class="green space-top" style="font-size:24px; padding-bottom:15px;">Step 3: Get in touch</h4>
    <p>Head over to the <a href="https://community.p2pu.org/" target="_blank">facilitator community</a> to share feedback, photos, suggestions, and questions with facilitators from 
    around the world.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:60px;">If you’d like to learn more about how P2PU can support you while you run your Learning Circles, <a href="mailto:thepeople@p2pu.org?Subject=Hi%20there!" target="_blank">get in 
    touch</a> and we can talk about it! Our services include facilitator training workshops, course selection and development, custom program design,
    ongoing facilitator support, web hosting, and software tool integration. If you're on your own and you just have a question, you can drop us a line too. :)</p>
    
    <!--<p>Learning Circles are lightly-facilitated study groups for learners who want to take 
    freely available online courses together, in-person. We believe that anybody can become a 
    facilitator, and whether you want to run a single Learning Circle in your home or organize 
    dozens across an urban library system, you've come to the right place.</p> 
    
    <p>You can run a Learning Circle with just this guide and an online course, but we highly recommend 
    creating your Learning Circle <a href="https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/facilitator/signup/">with our online tools</a>. These tools will 
    generate a webpage where people can signup for your Learning Circle, as well as a create a facilitator dashboard from where you can communicate 
    directly with learners via email or SMS, set up automatic reminders to go out before each Learning Circle, and 
    share weekly feedback with learners, P2PU, and other facilitators around the world.</p>
    
    <p>Now for the fun part. Start reading through this guide by navigating through the tabs to the left, or 
    <a href="https://www.p2pu.org/assets/uploads/learning_circle_downloads/facilitator_handbook.pdf">download it all</a> as a pdf that you can read offline. 
    Either way, you’ll see <i class="fa fa-desktop teal hpicon"></i> <span class="teal-highlights">green highlights</span> throughout that point out where our 
    online tools can support your Learning Circle.</p>
    
    <p>When you’re ready to begin, click on the button below to create your Learning Circle. You’ll have your own Learning Circle webpage ready to share in less than five minutes!</p>
