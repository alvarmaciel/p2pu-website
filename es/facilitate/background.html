    <p>For decades, online learning has offered the potential to deliver 
    cheap, flexible education to a large audience. As the field of online 
    learning has increased rapidly in the past few years, many advocates have
     claimed that online learning will democratize higher education and even
     make universities obsolete.</p> 
    <p>However, there are several barriers that have prevented such a 
    democratization from occurring. In order to succeed in learning online, 
    individuals must already be web savvy, self-directed learners with a 
    great deal of intrinsic motivation and discipline. Given this, it is not
     a surprise that the vast majority of those who complete online courses 
    already have a Bachelor’s degree.</p>
    <p>It is these two phenomena – the volume of high quality online 
    learning resources and the mounting evidence that they have not leveled 
    the educational playing field – that inspired Learning Circles. In early
     2015, P2PU and Chicago Public Library started working together to 
    deliver online courses in supportive and engaging library environments 
    across Chicago. Specifically targeting adult learners who do not yet 
    have an undergraduate degree, Learning Circles were designed to equip 
    participants with confidence and motivation, springboarding them into future
     educational and professional endeavors.</p>

    <h2>Open Educational Resources (OER)</h2>
    <p>Online learning has been around for decades. While some instituions pioneered online
learning with low-cost degree programs, others worked to publish stand-alone course
material online for free. By the early 2000s, many freely-available online learning materials
became unified under a banner known as Open Educational Resources (OER),
broadly defined as “teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public
domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their
free use and re-purposing by others”.</p>

    <p>Around 2008, a few individuals and institutions began to take OER one step further.
Instead of just sharing learning materials online, they started “running” free online
courses synchronously, where learners from around the world could sign up and work
through course materials together as an online community. These experiments were
coined as MOOCs: Massive Open Online Courses.</p>
     
    <h2>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)</h2>
    <p>It didn’t take long for MOOCs to catch on, and soon large universities such as Harvard,
MIT, and Stanford started designing their own MOOC platforms and partnering with
universities around the world to transform university courses into MOOCs and publish
them online for anyone to access.</p>
    <p>Some MOOCs are digital versions of existing courses, where professors deliver their
lectures via video and upload readings to a website. Other MOOCs take advantage of
the online medium, and create new types learning experiences for online learners. One
thing most MOOCs share is that they require learners to be self-directed and motivated,
and to be comfortable working online. Partially because of this, the vast majority of
MOOC participants drop out without finishing their course.</p>
    <p>To support learners who lack these requirements (or just enjoy learning together),
Learning Circles position MOOCs in a social space. Emphasizing <span class="bold">peer learning</span>
and <span class="bold">academic mindsets</span>, a diverse group of learners can now benefit from online learning
as they develop cognitive skills, explore new learning strategies, and improve their
digital literacy with others from their respective local communities.</p>

    <h2>Peer Learning</h2>
    <p class="list-below">There are three values that underlie P2PU’s concept of peer learning:</p>  
    <ul>
    <li>Everybody is an expert in something.</li>
    <li>Sharing is how we learn best.</li>
    <li>Feedback is necessary in order to improve.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By convening a group of learners who are interested in a similar 
    topic, you’ve got the basis for an open, collaborative learning 
    environment that has the the potential to be the support system many 
    learners need. Peer learning can create a rich learning environment in 
    which everyone simultaneously teaches and learns, acts and observes, 
    speaks and listens. This exposes learners of all stripes and sizes to 
    new perspectives, provides an opportunity to develop useful social 
    skills, and allows individuals to achieve something greater than they 
    could have on their own.</p>

    <h2>Academic Mindsets</h2>
    <p class="list-below">Academic mindsets is a term used to describe the 
    beliefs that learners have about themselves, their intelligence, and 
    their abilities. These mindsets influence a learner’s motivation and 
    perseverance, which in turn influences their study habits and overall 
    academic performance. A positive academic mindset is described in four 
    statements:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>“I belong to this community”</li>
    <li>“My ability and competence grow with my effort”</li>
    <li>“I can succeed at this”</li>
    <li>“This work has value for me”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Learning Circles support academic mindsets by combining group 
    activities with course content. These activities will help learners 
    develop a learning community, set and achieve attainable goals, develop 
    new learning strategies, connect the work to their goals, and reflect 
    and improve upon the Learning Circle model. Many learners have told us 
    that the development of these skills is equally or even more powerful 
    than learning new content from the online course material.</p>
