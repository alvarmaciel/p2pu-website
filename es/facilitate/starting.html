    <p>Here you will find a checklist that outlines the steps needed to get your Learning Circle
running. Do not worry - each of these steps is explained in the following pages. You can
compress or expand this timeline to suit your needs. However, if you don’t already have
a dedicated group of learners, we recommend spending four weeks promoting your
Learning Circle once you’ve finalized the date, time, course, and location.</p>

    <h2>Choose a course</h2>
    <p>There are many online providers that offer free online courses. But not all courses are
created equal. Here are 3 steps to choosing the perfect course for your Learning Circle.</p>

    <h3>1. Know your community</h3>
    <p>You need to identify a course that will resonate with the learners 
    you anticipate working with. Here are a few questions to get you 
    thinking:</p>


    <h4>What knowledge gaps exist in your community?</h4> 
    <p>Is there a need for subjects that aren’t available where you live? 
    Examples include learning Spanish, preparing for the High School Equivalency 
    (such as GED®, HiSET®, or TASC®), or building a website with HTML/CSS.</p>
    <h4>Who do you expect to attend?</h4>
    <p>If you’ll be working with learners who aren’t fully employed, you may
     want to choose a course that supports finding new work or skilling up 
    (such as resume writing, public speaking, or academic writing). Be sure 
    to look at the prerequisites for the courses and make sure the content 
    isn’t too basic or too advanced and advertise appropriately.</p>
    <h4>What would you like to learn?</h4> 
    <p>If you are passionate about the subject matter, it will resonate with learners.</p>


    <h3>2. Identify possible courses</h3>
    <p class="list-below">There are a number of ways to search for online courses. Regardless of how you choose a course, make sure you download
    the <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/facilitate/downloads/">platform guides</a> to help learners get set up for the first time. Here are a few options for choosing a course:</p>
    <ul class="list-below">
    <li>Head over to <a href="https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/courses" target="_blank">learningcircles.p2pu.org/courses</a>
     to see courses we’ve used in the past. </li>
    <li>Check out <a href="https://www.class-central.com/" target="_blank">class-central.com</a>, a good aggregator of all online courses.</li>
    <li>Search by subject by platform. Platforms we’ve worked with in the past include:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="sublist">
    <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/" target="_blank">FutureLearn</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT OpenCourseware</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://novoed.com/" target="_blank">NovoEd</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Choose the best fit</h3>
    <p>Once you’ve identified a few courses that will interest your 
    community, whittle the list down further. Use these criteria to identify
     good courses for your Learning Circle:</p>
    <h4>Logistics: Does the course meet the course criteria?</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Free (free enrolment and free access to all course materials)</li>
    <li>English-medium (or whichever language you choose)</li>
    <li>Creative Commons license (rather than copyrighted)</li>
    <li>Either open enrollment or a start date that suits your schedule</li>
    <li>Not too long (we recommend 5-8 week long courses)</li>
    <li>Low weekly commitment (varies if learners commit to doing additional work)</li>
    <li>No additional software required aside from browser and a word processor</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Relevance to your community</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Is the subject matter interesting and relevant to the learners you anticipate working with?</li>
    <li>Are there prerequisites that will prevent many people from taking this course?</li>
    <li>Is the subject matter interesting for you to facilitate/study alongside learners?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Quality of Instruction</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Does the mode of instruction seem engaging and effective?</li>
    <li>Are the course materials and the platform intuitive to use?</li>
    <li>Is there a clear sense of expertise present in the course materials?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Coherent as a Learning Circle</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Will learners easily be able to give feedback to one another given the content?</li>
    <li>Do the activities make sense being done together as group work?</li>
    <li>Can you clearly imagine your role facilitating this course in-person?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Opportunities for feedback</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Do the assessments seem to reinforce course materials?</li>
    <li>Is there an active online community/access to mentors?</li>
    <li>Is there a clear way to get in touch with someone on the website if you run into technical difficulties?</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Find a quiet space</h2>
    <p>Try and find a space that you can use consistently for 90-120 minutes each week.</p>

    <h4>Essentials</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Easily accessible space</li>
    <li>Consistent access to power</li>
    <li>Consistent access to free internet</li>
    <li>Accomodation for any physical and/or learning disabilities in the group</li>
    <li>Restroom availability</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Desirables</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>A large wall for projecting on</li>
    <li>Natural light (<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-11/sp-rrf103114.php" target="_blank">studies show</a> that people learn better with it)</li>
    <li>Modular seating arrangements</li>
    <li>Near public transport / free parking</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Make sure</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Have the times been booked for each week?</li>
    <li>Do you have access to any keys that you need?</li>
    <li>Do you know the wifi network name and password?</li>
    <li>Do you know where chairs, tables, and additional supplies are stored?</li>
    <li>Are you aware of any rules determining what time you must finish by each week?</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Gather supplies</h2>
    <p>There are few things you should have ready before Learning Circles begin.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Laptops for all participants (if they don’t have their own)</li>
    <li>Headphones for participants (if they don’t have their own)</li>
    <li>Internet browser (such as Google Chrome) and word processor such as Google Docs, Pages, or Microsoft Word</li>
    <li>Any additional software the course might require (this is rare)</li>
    <li>A projector and relevant HDMI or Mini DisplayPort adapter</li>
    <li>A projector screen (if there is no wall to project onto in your space)</li>
    <li>Adequate number of powerstrips and adapters</li>
    <li>Phone/camera (to record and share materials)</li>
    <li>Notebook and a pen</li>
    <li>Name tags (use them until you are sure everybody is familiar with each other)</li>
    <li>A few extra applications (for walk-ins)</li>
    <li>Snacks (if possible/appropriate)</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Identify learners</h2>
    <p>Learning Circles work best with small, enthusiastic groups of people -
     ideally between 4 and 10 learners. We recommend that you start these 
    promotion activities 4 weeks before your Circle starts.</p>

    <h3>1. Establish a web presence</h3>
    <p>Create and share a public event on your blog, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or an online event registration site such as <a href="https://goo.gl/6E9vYX" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a> so you can publicize your Learning Circle electronically.</p>
    <p class="highlightp"><span class="teal-highlights">If you are using our software, you’ll have your very own Learning Circle webpage that you can share far and wide.</span></p>
    
    <h3>2. Prepare the application</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the application is to get a little background on the learners, not to create
a selective admission process. If there are prerequisites for the course you are facilitating,
then you should make that clear in your messaging . There is a <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/facilitate/downloads/">short application</a>
available for download that you can either print out for learners or share electronically. </p>
    <p class="highlightp"><span class="teal-highlights">If you are using our software, learners can sign up directly on your Learning Circle website and you can monitor signups from your facilitator dashboard.</span></p> 

    <h4>The application includes</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Name and email address/phone number (so you can contact them).</li>
    <li>Goals (so you know what they are looking to get out of it).</li>
    <li>How they’ll help their peers (to get them thinking about peer learning).</li>
    <li>Quick digital skills self-assessment (so you can see the range of 
    digital comfort in the course). We find that scoring 15 or higher makes 
    you a good candidate for a Learning Circle.</li>
    <li>Whether they have a laptop and headphones (if they don’t have a 
    laptop and you can’t provide extras, then these people will not be able 
    to attend unless they can figure out a way to borrow one. Headphones are
     useful but not essential in some courses).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Customize the flyer</h3>
    <p class="list-below">Eye-catching flyers and posters are an excellent 
    way to promote your Learning Circle, both digitally and in print. There is a
    <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/facilitate/downloads/">basic flyer</a> that you can download, or feel 
    free to get creative and make your own! Just remember to include the following information:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Name of the course</li>
    <li>Date, time, and venue of the meetings</li>
    <li>How many weeks the course will run for</li>
    <li>Anything participants should bring with them</li>
    <li>Any prerequisites</li>
    <li>A contact number, weblink, or email address where people can find out more</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Print the poster and put it in noticeable places around your venue, 
    such as entrances, information or library circulation desks, computer 
    terminals, or near other resources related to the course you are 
    running. You can also share the flyer with organisations, community 
    groups, local coffee shops, or bookstores - any place where potential 
    learners may wander!</p>


    <h3>4. Reach out to your communities</h3>
    <p>Now that your materials are ready, you can start identifying 
    learners. Nobody understands your networks better than you do, so you’ll
     know the best way to reach them. We’ve provided templates that you can 
    use to get started in a number of different mediums.</p>
     
    <h4>Email</h4>
    <p>Got a mailing list? If so, you might want to use this message to find potential learners. If
you don't have a Learning Circle website, make sure you attach the application!</p>

    <p class="template">Are you interested in taking a free and open online 
    course, but don’t want to study alone? Why not join our Learning Circle,
     and study face-to-face with your peers?</p>
    <p class="template">From _______ (date) ________ to _______ (date) 
    _______ we’ll be meeting in _______ (venue) _______ to work together 
    through a course on ________ (subject) _______ in a supportive, 
    peer-oriented group. We won’t have a teacher - we’ll be teaching each 
    other!</p>
    <p class="template">There are no prerequisites for the course, but access to a laptop and some experience of using the Web would be helpful.</p>
    <p class="template">For more information, visit _______ (link to website) _______ or send an email to ________ (your email) 
    _______ and we will send you a link to an application and more 
    information.</p>


    <h4>Facebook</h4>
    <p>Does your community use Facebook? If so, try this post as a first 
    step. Remember, people get a lot of information via social media, so to 
    be really impactful, post reminders to Facebook about once per day. 
    Remember to tag any individuals, projects, locations or groups who you 
    think might be interested in joining your Learning Circle.</p>

    <p class="template">Interested in ______(course subject)_______? Don’t want to do it 
    alone? Join a #learningcircle at ______(venue)_______ to meet each week and work through
    an online course together. The Learning Circle starts ______(start date)______. For more information 
    and to apply online:  _______ (link to website) _______.</p>


    <h4>Twitter</h4>
    <p>If your community uses Twitter for sharing information, then you can 
    use the two template Tweets below to get started. To really get noticed,
     you should tweet these messages at least 3 times per day, and come up 
    with a hashtag so people can search for the messages. Remember to add 
    the link to your Learining Circle website, too!</p>

    <p class="template">Learn ______(course subject)_______ together at ______(venue)_______.  
    #learningcircles start _______(start date)________. Sign up: _______ (link to website) _______. </p>

    <p class="template">In #______(city)_______? Want to learn together? Join #learningcircles at
    ______(venue)_______. Sign up: _______ (link to website) _______. </p>


    <h3>5. Reach out to other community groups</h3>
    <p>Depending on the topic of your Learning Circle, you should consider reaching out
to other local organizations who share an interest in the subject. For example, local
historical societies will have members who are interested in history courses and youth
groups might be interested in courses that train young people who are looking for jobs.
Check out the email template on the following page.</p>
   <p>If your Learning Circle is taking place in a venue that has a schedule, public calendar,
or newsletter, ask the administrators if you can add a notice about the Learning Circle
- these are very good ways of reaching potential participants. Likewise, if your venue
uses social media ask them to post and tweet on your behalf. </p>


    <p class="template">Dear ____________</p>
    <p class="template">We thought you might be interested in a learning 
    project taking place in your community. We are going to be hosting a 
    Learning Circle - a free, peer-led study group for learners who want to 
    take online courses together in a public space. </p>

    <p class="template">Each week, learners will meet for approximately 90 
    minutes to work through learning materials about _______(subject)_______
     together. </p>

    <p class="template">The Circle will run from _____(start time)_______ to
     _____(end time)______ on the following dates: _____(dates)_____ 
    in the following venue: _____(venue)_____. </p>

    <p class="template">Interested people can learn more and sign up at _______ (link to website) _______. Please pass this message on to anyone in your 
    community who you think might be interested, and get in touch if you 
    have any questions.</p> 

    <p class="template">Regards</p>

    <p class="template">____________________</p>


    <h3>6. Confirm with the learners</h3>
    <p>As learners apply, you should confirm whether or not they will be 
    part of the group. If their skill level seems too low, suggest that they
     turn to their local library or other community learning space where 
    digital literacy is taught. Remember, everyone is a beginner sometime, 
    so be sure to be encouraging and supportive when you direct people 
    elsewhere. Below, we’ve created a sample acceptance and decline message that you can use when you respond to applicants.</p> 
    
    <p class="highlightp"><span class="teal-highlights">If you are using our software, you can log on to your dashboard to view applications and get in touch with applicants.</span></p>


    <h4>Sample Acceptance message</h4>

    <p class="template">Dear _______________</p> 

    <p class="template">Thanks for getting in touch and wanting to join the 
    Learning Circle about ______(subject)_______ starting ______(date)_____.
     From the signup information you shared, you look like you’ll be a 
    perfect fit for the Learning Circle. We look forward to having you join us.</p>  

    <p class="template">We’ll be sending more information about the Learning Circle soon.</p>  

    <h4>Sample Decline message</h4>

    <p class="template">Dear _______________</p>

    <p class="template">Thanks for getting in touch and wanting to join the 
    Learning Circle on _______(subject)_______ starting ______(date)______.
     From the signup information you shared, it looks like your digital skills aren't
     quite high enough to benefit from the Learning Circle. You 
    might want to consider approaching your local library branch, community 
    center, or _______(specific resource in your community)_______ to find out where you can 
    boost your digital skills so you can participate in the future.</p> 

    <p class="template">Good luck with your online learning adventure!</p>
