There is a huge volume of free, high-quality learning courses available online, but completion rates for online learning remain around 5%, and learning materials are often inaccessible to individuals who are not computer savvy. In an effort to make the rewards of online learning materials accessible to a wider audience, P2PU has developed a social wrapper for online learning, allowing groups of individuals to come together and meaningfully engage with online educational resources in an empowering, peer learning environment.

With funding from the Knight Foundation News Challenge, P2PU and Chicago Public Library pioneered Learning Circles: lightly-facilitated study groups for adult learners who want to take online courses together at their local library. We worked with 11 branches, delivering 17 Learning Circles in topics including HTML/CSS (Udacity), public speaking (Coursera), and preparation for the Registered Nurse licensing exam (Khan Academy). Learning Circles met for between 6-8 weeks, contained between 2-15 learners, and were facilitated by librarians who were not content experts in the subject matter.

Retention over 6 weeks was 45%, much higher than retention generally found in online courses. Additionally, 65% of learners we worked with had never taken an online course before, and a full 90% of learners were interested in taking another Learning Circle in 2016. Every librarian we worked with is on board to continue facilitating Learning Circles in 2016.

Working with facilitators, librarians, and course participants, P2PU developed a learning circle kit, comprised of software tools, facilitation guides, a list of curated courses, and marketing templates that make it easy for individuals to organize learning circles with little additional help needed. Whether you want to run a single Learning Circle in your home or organize 100 across an urban library system, we’re developing a guide to help you on your journey. **Check back here on January 31, 2016 to see the guide.**

Additionally, P2PU can consult individuals and organizations looking to get started with Learning Circles. Our services include facilitator training workshops, course selection and adaption expertise, ongoing facilitator support, web hosting, and software tool integration. We are happy to have a 15 minute call with you to talk about strategy and answer any questions you might have - email <a href="mailto:thepeople@p2pu.org">thepeople@p2pu.org</a> to get that set up.
